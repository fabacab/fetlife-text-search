# FetLife Text Search

The FetLife Text Search user script allows you to perform full-text searches for an arbitrary keyword, phrase, or user nickname across all discussions in a [FetLife](https://fetlife.com/) Group. This user script implements a client-side version of [the following FetLife improvement suggestion](https://fetlife.com/improvements/942):

> be able to search a forum or (possibly all forums) by username
>
> to retrieve thier posts. Frequently I can remember an awesome thing I read and who posted it, but cannot remember in what forum or thread. Unless it is a recent thing that I can find easily on their profile page, the wisdom is lost to me.
And on rare occassion I actually post something worth reading and hate it when I cant remember where or when I did so!

With the FetLife Text Search user script installed, a few clicks will save hours of time. Now you can find comments on threads even after they're deeply buried that match your search keywords in a matter of seconds. The script returns results in context, and you can click on the search result to go directly to the comment in the original thread.
